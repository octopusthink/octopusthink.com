We needed a design system and component library that was inclusive, usable, and flexible enough to allow for a wide range of brand expressions, but this didn't exist in the open-source landscape. Many design systems failed to meet the usability and accessibility standards we hold ourselves accountable to.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"Yet another design system?\"\n  heading=\"Why bother?\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/structure-diagram.png\"\n  alt=\"Diagram of Nautilus' intended structure\"\n  next=\"visual-audit\"\n  >\n\nBuilding our own design system allows us to establish a solid, predictable baseline for my work without needing to reinvent the wheel every time, allowing us more room for experimentation and innovation.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"That's a lot of pink\"\n  heading=\"Visual audit\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/audit.png\"\n  alt=\"Screenshots of different web components\"\n  next=\"principles\"\n  >\n\nOur first step was to assess what we already had by looking at recent work. This audit revealed a consistent style—clarity, contrast, and boldness. This formed the basis for foundational guidelines, a type system, design tokens, as well as the components themselves.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"What we stand for\"\n  heading=\"Principles\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/principles.png\"\n  alt=\"Design principles: Be bold, be clear, be inclusive, be smart.\"\n  next=\"colour\"\n  >\n\nDesign principles are key to a design system. When used correctly and well established, they infuse and inform every other decision. It was important to establish these principles early into the process, since everything else derives from them. Via a series of post-it note exercises, we established a shared vision and a clear set of guiding principles to inform all work to come.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"Other than pink, that is\"\n  heading=\"Colour\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/colour.png\"\n  alt=\"Colour palettes\"\n  next=\"typography\"\n  >\n\nNautilus provides a palette of seven hues, each with 10 tints and shades, balanced against a greyscale gradient to ensure predictable numerical contrast for accessibility purposes. It also provides a neutral palette of greys to match. Components check for adequate colour contrast to ensure accessibility.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"Establishing typographic scales\"\n  heading=\"Typography\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/typography.png\"\n  alt=\"A series of headings and text in different sizes, in descending order.\"\n  next=\"spacing\"\n  >\n\nNautilus includes a flexible type system, including rules for calculating type scales and for programmatically determining an optimal line-height that would still fall on our baseline grid.\n\nSemantic combinations for different \"voices\" and contexts forms the baseline of the type system. Type variables are themeable, as are the actual combinations of tokens into semantic styles, making for a highly flexible system with core rules.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"Grids, gutters, and rhythm\"\n  heading=\"Spacing\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/spacing.png\"\n  alt=\"Tables showing spacing components, visualised as blocks, for padding and margin.\"\n  next=\"react-components\"\n  >\n\nNautilus uses the popular `8px` grid due to its flexibility and ease of use with icons and other elements. It also includes spacing variables and rules for how padding and margin is applied to elements. This leads to more harmonious visual layouts.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"Now for the easy part\"\n  heading=\"React components\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/components.png\"\n  alt=\"Screenshots of different UI components: card, input, and icon.\"\n  next=\"project-management\"\n  >\n\nWe build each component collaboratively, starting with research and documentation, and then building out the components in React and reviewing back and forth until everything is accessible, usable, and conforms to our standards.\n\n</PortfolioSection>\n<PortfolioSection\n  metadata=\"Maintaining momentum\"\n  heading=\"Project management\"\n  image=\"/portfolio/nautilus/project-management.png\"\n  alt=\"Screenshots of GitHub project board.\"\n  next=\"future-plans\"\n  >\n\nWe invest time in ensuring that everything is well-documented and a clear process has been established.
