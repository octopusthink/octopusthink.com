We've been working remotely, in some form or another, for at least a decade. We know what sucks about video meetings—saying something you didn't mean to, or getting five minutes into a poignant tirade before being interrupted by a co-worker: "We can't hear you! Is your mic off?"

So we built Mic Drop. It's an app that allows you to mute—and unmute—your mic using a customisable keyboard shortcut that works in any app. It also displays your mic status in your menu bar or in a floating window, so you'll always know at a glance if your mic is hot or not.
