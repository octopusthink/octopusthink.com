<div>
  <IconHeading problem />

YouTube creators are at the mercy of _the algorithm_. Long-form content loses out to daily vlogs and product unboxings. For the group of STEM and educational YouTubers at Standard, this made it difficult to take risks on YouTube.

<!--
while demonitization of advertiser-unfriendly content increases

YouTube's algorithm prioritses consistent, safe content that keeps user engagement and watch time up—daily vlogs and unboxing videos win out over educational and long-form content. With videos increasingly demonitised by algorithms during their most-watched time windows, taking any risks on YouTube can be a channel-ending endeavour.

Launch a simple, content-rich streaming video platform allowing creators to take risks and publish content directly to their fans without advertiser or platform interference.

  <IconHeading result />

Launch wildly exceeded expectations—the site reached over ten thousand subscribers in a month and continues to grow. New Nebula Originals release regularly, and Curiousity Stream has since partnered with Nebula.

Standard Broadcast is a group of YouTube creators, with a focus on educational and STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathmaticals) content. Standard creators have audiences from hundreds of thousands to millions of people, and are some of the most-subscribed channels on YouTube.

<!--
Nebula was conceived not as a YouTube competitor; instead, it was intended as a place for YouTube creators to release additional or less-convential content. To ensure the platform could be an open ground for creativity
-->

The Nebula site was developed and launched in under six months. Standard had an existing, in-house design & development team that would maintain Nebula, so Matt wrote thorough documentation and rigourous tests.

Nebula is built using server-side React, Redux, and Django, all deployed to AWS for high-availability. The website is entirely responsive and works great on mobile. Because an iPad and Android versions were not launch plans, the responsiveness meant tablet and Android users weren't left out at launch.

Standard had a deal with an existing "over-the-top" video hosting provider, so we built an API on top of their existing infrastructure—that API powers the website, iOS app, a forthcoming Android app, and internal reporting tools. We worked with the video provider to improve their service and beta test new features like video upload APIs.

Standard creators have a collective tens of millions of followers, so we wanted to ensure the site wouldn't fall over if popular. The site was deployed to AWS, on a scaling, self-healing Kubernetes cluster. Despite large numbers of sign-ups and visitors during the "soft-launch", the site never encountered issues.

Nebula's launch exceeded all stretch goals, and is now a new business venture for Standard. Once in the business of helping creators on existing platforms, Standard now has a platform of its own. Its success on the web has encouraged Standard to invest further in the platform, developing an iPad and Android app.
