title: Happy Octopus Day!
summary: Because it's the 8th of October, of course. It's also Ada Lovelace Day, so basically, it's auspicious all around.

We've been very busy working on Secretive Things and Underwater Planning and (some of us) have been even taking a break before diving into projects, but we couldn't resist putting a wee something together in celebration of our first [World Octopus Day](https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/world-octopus-day/):

[funfactsaboutoctopus.es](https://funfactsaboutoctopus.es)

We've started it off with eight of our favourite octopus facts, and we'll be adding to it sporadically (the best interval!) over the next year. If you've some octopus-facts or octopus art to share, please don't hesitate to [reach out](https://github.com/octopusthink/funfactsaboutoctopus.es/issues/new). (It's open-source, so your pull requests are always welcome!)
