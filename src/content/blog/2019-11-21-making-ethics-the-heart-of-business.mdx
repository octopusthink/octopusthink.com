title: Making ethics the beating heart(s) of our business
summary: Saying you're all about ethics is one thing, but actually quantifying it and holding yourself accountable is another thing entirely. Let's get specific about what that actually means.

One sunny morning earlier this year, Matt and I made a giant pot of Chemex and conducted a series of exercises to determine our brand. Covering our newly-tiled kitchen walls with post-it notes helped us better understand our shared values, priorities, and motivators. One of the themes that was especially prominent was that of ethics.

We've both spent a long time working for big tech companies and paying attention as the way we interact with technology changes, and we both care deeply about doing our best to make the tech industry a more diverse and ethical place. We genuinely believe that technology is a tool for humans, and that it's more and more important that we wield it carefully, thoughtfully, and deliberately.

It's all well and good saying we care about ethics, or signing whatever pledge might be making the rounds, or putting a #TechForGood hashtag on all our tweets. But if we don't back that up with a clear and concrete declaration of what that actually means in practise, it's just ethics-washing. (I made that up right now. Feel free to use it.)

So we've established some guidelines for *what our ethics are* and *what that means in practise*. And we're making it public, because that keeps us accountable. (And one of our values is transparency!)

These ethical stances, in order to be valid, underpin every decision we make. It means we have long discussions about the suppliers and services we use. It means we need to balance cost and features with impact on the world. We aren’t ascetic about it, but aim to make the best decision possible.

[maybe an image of a three, in the style of the others?]

Three is a lovely auspicious number. There's three wishes, three little pigs, three musketeers, a holy trinity or two, three witches, three Fates—and it's a helpful number for making things pretty, as seen by [the rule of thirds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds), not to be confused with [the rule of three](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)) or [any other three-rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three).

[Octopuses have three hearts](https://funfactsaboutoctopus.es/three-hearts), and so do we. (Metaphorically, that is.)

## Inclusion

Inclusion is the root of everything that we do. It's the absolute core of our business and our ethics. Technology has the power to be a social equaliser. But it often seems that new technical developments can serve to exclude, isolate, or silence people.

In practise, this means that we always think about the different types of users who will be affected by the things we build. We use persona spectrums and consequence mapping. We design with accessibility at the forefront. Our design system is rooted in inclusive principles and features accessible components. We try to use whatever power or influence we may (or may not!) have to lift others up. We check our privilege and actively continue to educate ourselves.

It's practically impossible to build a product for literally every person in the world, but we design our products and services so that as many people who *want* to use them can, and we reject the notion that inclusivity is antithetic to bold product designs.

## Respect

Respect means treating our users, clients, and anyone who our technology may impact with the kind of respect we’d like to be given.

In practise, this means we avoid designing or implementing dark patterns. We put users' privacy and security at the forefront of how we build things. We don’t trick, coerce, or manipulate people. We are open and transparent in everything we do, and how everything we build works. We don’t take VC funding and instead bootstrap our work, ensuring our sole responsibility is to our customers.

Not everyone wants to know how the sausage gets made, but if you do: we will (gladly) let you know.

## Sustainability

When we think of sustainability, we think of both environmental and economic resilience. This widens our scope and allows us to think more broadly about how our business impacts the world we all inhabit.  How are our individual choices, on both a personal and a profession level, impacting the world at large? Are we following campground rules?

In practise, this means we’ve built a sustainable business model based on controlled and deliberate growth. We pay our taxes. Our primary responsibility is to our customers, not shareholders. We don't take work with Halliburton, Goldman Sachs, or Enron (not that they're offering). We consider the environmental impact of our work. We're evaluating options for green hosting. We build sites to be as performant as possible (this site loads in x seconds!). We don’t print very much. We don't commute anywhere (we don’t even own a car) and all of our electricity at home comes from 100% renewable sources. (It may or may not help that we live in the windiest country in Europe.)

## How these hearts define our business

These are the core ethics that drive us. Everything we do is derived from these three hearts. Our values, brand, and design principles all tie back to our ethics. Every decision we make—whether to include a popup here, what analytics package to use, whether or not to pursue a new contract—is assessed through these lenses. Ethics aren't the only metrics by which we make our decisions, but they're a hugely important component.

The tricky thing about ethics—and being public about those ethics—is that there's always a risk you'll get it wrong. Getting it wrong in public is one thing, but getting your ethics wrong is a whole other thing entirely. Reputations have been made and ruined by a misguided tweet.

We’re (mostly) okay with that risk. We’d rather try and fail than not try at all, and we genuinely believe that by being as transparent as possible, we hold ourselves more accountable to our own standards. And they're good standards—we checked.

So we'd love your feedback if you see us getting it wrong, or if we're failing to consider things fully, or if we could be better decisions. We aren't perfect, but we want to be better. ❤️❤️❤️
