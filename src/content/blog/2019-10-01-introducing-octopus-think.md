summary: Let's talk about design. And technology. And cephalopods, because we can't always be that serious.

Hi there! We're Sarah and Matt, and together, we're Octopus Think, a digital design and development agency.

## About us

Sarah calls herself a "designer who codes", which basically just means she's a control freak who likes to get her hands messy with code. Her background is in visual or graphic design, but she moved into product and UX design once she finally realised she cares just as much about how it works as how it looks. She's a holistic designer who can connect the user experience to brand all the way through to implementation. She's passionate about leveraging technology in order to create social change and make the world a more equitable place.

Matt is a full-stack developer with a wide range of skills, although you'll most often see him working with React frontends. An advocate for accessibility and inclusion, Matt's work leverages best practises and new tools in technology without leaving anyone out. He's passionate about using technology to automate tasks and he's

Together, we've worked on an array of different side projects over the years, and we've always enjoyed working with one another. (We also happen to live together, which probably strengthens this relationship to some degree.)

Our skills are highly complementary with very little overlap, making it easy to have ownership in a joint project and make decisions in a diplomatic way. We care deeply about building the best products we can and often will argue small details at length, but in a way that's respectful and constructive.

Where we _do_ overlap is the passions that ignite us: automation, inclusion, big butts. That's where we'll be directing a lot of our energies.

## What we're working on

Right now, a lot of our time has been devoted to [Nautilus](https://nautilus.octopusthink.com), our open-source inclusive design system. We're investing time in Nautilus right now so we have a solid baseline upon which to iterate, and so we'll be able to more effectively build products and apps that are consistent, accessible, and pleasurable to use.

We have a lot of different ideas brewingâ€”follow along to see what comes out!

## What to expect

We're going to talk about things that matter to us: Design and technology. Accessibility and inclusion. And adorable cephalopod stories, because nobody can be serious all the time, and we aren't stones. They're _really adorable_!
