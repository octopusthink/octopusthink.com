  Building a website from scratch is a challenge for small businesses, who often lack the resources to pay a professional. Doing it yourself can be a painful process involving a great many steps and continual context-switching. Even for agencies and freelancers who build WordPress sites every day, the process is needlessly complex and time-consuming.

  Often times businesses give up and have no website at all—settling on just a Facebook page as their web presence.

  Rivet aimed to simplify that process and make it as easy as possible for small businesses to get up and running with a simple one-page website that would meet their needs. The goal was to automate as much of the process of designing and building a website as possible.

  I kicked off the project with some exploratory user research, talking to small business owners to get a better understanding of their needs and pain points as they relate to websites.

  A key finding was that they had no real interest in the process of building a site and didn’t have the budget to hire someone to take it on. I also discovered that content generation was a huge blocker, and many people abandoned sites on WordPress.com full of dummy content.

  I also conducted competitive analysis to benchmark competitors and upstarts in this space.
