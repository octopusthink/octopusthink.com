If you need smart, passionate, and pragmatic humans (or ocean-dwellers) to help out with your projects, we're here for you!

We work remotely by default and provide frequent, open updates on your project. We've worked remotely for the past decade, but we can work with you on-site for parts of your project. We're also available to do on-site training and workshops.

Here are a few things we can help with:

## Development

- React and React-Native development (React, Redux, React Hooks, GraphQL, Flow, TypeScript)
- Full-stack web development (Django, Rails, WordPress, React)
- Accessibility (accessible design, accessibility audits/compliance, JAWS/NVDA/VoiceOver testing)
- WordPress development (Gutenberg blocks, plugin development, theme development)
- iOS Development (Swift and React Native)

## Design

- Graphic design (logos, visual design, web design, branding)
- Product design (UI, UX, mockups, prototypes, user flows, design systems)
- User research & usability testing

## Other stuff

- Documentation and copy-editing
- Open source software (community, development, project management)
- Workflow & automation (continuous integration, DevOps, git, GitHub, testing)
- Bespoke workshops and training (remote work, React, open source, automation, DevOps, user research, design systems)
