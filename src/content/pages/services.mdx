title: What we do
summary: |
  We have a broad range of skills and take a holistic approach to solving problems for clients. Our small, agile team is able to help with everything from app development to print design.

  Want an accessibility audit? We can do that. UX and user research? Sure. A React app plus an accompanying API running on AWS? You got it. What about a design system built from scratch? You get the idea: we're here to help you kick ass.

## What we know

We have **decades of experience** working on the web—we remember when bandwidth was measured in baud. Over that time, we've picked up a whole range of different skills and keep ourselves up-to-date with best practices in design & development.

Rather than being narrowly scoped, we have a range of skills and experience allowing us to approach projects with a holistic understanding of how everything fits together. We can smoothly shepherd your project through all phases of implementation—from **research to design, development to deployment**: Octopus Think does it.

Some may think that makes us masters of none, but we don't believe that (and neither do our clients!)

  <Paragraph inverse>
    Not sure how to get started, what JavaScript framework you need, or what your users really need?
    We can help with planning, strategy, and execution. We also offer bespoke training and
    workshops, on-site or remotely.

<IllustratedPoint label="Accessibility" illustration={AccessibilityIllustration}>
  <Paragraph inverse>
    Accessibility and inclusion are fundamental to good design. Everything we make begins with an
    inclusive design process and is built to accessible standards. We can also help with audits,
    compliance, and testing.

<IllustratedPoint label="Web development" illustration={WebIllustration}>
  <Paragraph inverse>
    Because you need more than just a Facebook page. Django, WordPress, Gatsby, React, Rails—we've
    been doing this a long time, so we know how to design & build gorgeous websites that are fast,
    accessible, and mobile-optimised. Oh, and they'll be SEO optimised and privacy-aware to boot.

<IllustratedPoint label="App development" illustration={AppIllustration}>
  <Paragraph inverse>
    Need a web app or a native mobile app? We love building apps that delight users and solve real
    problems. Whether it's a React Native app or a full-stack solution, you can rest assured that
    you'll end up with an app that's stable, performant, easy to use, and delightful.
  </Paragraph>

<IllustratedPoint label="Product design" illustration={ProductIllustration}>
  <Paragraph inverse>
    Design isn't just about making it pretty—it's about how it works. We approach problems from a
    user-centric perspective, ensuring every interaction is intuitive and pleasant. From user
    research to usability testing and all the journey maps, wireframes, and prototypes in between,
    we've got you covered.
  </Paragraph>
</IllustratedPoint>

<IllustratedPoint label="Visual design" illustration={VisualIllustration}>
  <Paragraph inverse>
    Once you've got everything usable, you may want to make it pretty after all. Graphic design is
    about using visual media to communicate a message. Whatever you need—design systems, branding,
    visualisations, web design—we ensure your message is communicated clearly and effectively.

## How we work

Every project is different, so we don't adhere to a rigid process. Our process follows an adaptable framework that responds to the unique needs of your project.

<!-- [process diagram] -->

We've spent the last decade working remotely with small and large organisations so we're great communicators and we know how to manage work across divergent time zones. We're also available to work on-site if the project calls for it, to do staff training, or for short periods during a longer project. Here's what you can expect of working with us:

<div
  css={css`
    li {
      margin-bottom: 1.6rem;
    }
  `}
>

- **Frequent status updates.** Communication is what makes or breaks a project.
- **Clear milestones, ownership, and deliverables.** Setting expectations up-front and having clear lines of delivery makes for a smoother, more pleasant experience.
- **Friendly, open, and transparent communication.** It's easier to be straightforward about concerns, delays, improvements, or suggestions. When we each respect one another's time, we can get more done.
- **Zero bullshit.** We don't believe in busywork, complex hierarchies of middle-management, or needless meetings. Instead, we're going to focus on getting things done and getting them done _well_.
- **Agility and pragmatism.** We aren't dogmatic about things, and we don't believe in one-size-fits-all solutions. Instead, we'll work with you to determine the technologies, tools, and process that best fits your needs.
- **A stress-free launch day.** We know launching a product is a big deal. We'll be on call for you all day, taking care of anything unexpected that comes up. That way, all you need to do is sit back and watch the compliments come rolling in.

If you're ready to discuss your project with us, [drop us a line](/contact) for a no-strings-attached estimate.

Just in the planning stages? **Reach out anyway!** We can help you plan, focus, research, and give you unbiased feedback about your idea. We once talked a client out of a lucrative contract because it wasn't the best fit for their needs. Rest assured we have no interest in up-selling you.
