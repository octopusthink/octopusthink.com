## Firefox Add-ons

Matt was instrumental in the re-architecting of Firefox Add-ons website from a legacy Django + PHP site to a modern React site.

During the migration to WebExtensions, it was clear that the legacy Firefox Add-ons website had grown too large to maintain, so Matt worked to migrate the site to a well-tested, responsive React site with Flow, Redux, redux-saga, and server-side rendering.

The [code for the Add-ons website is available on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend).

## WordPress

Sarah was a full-time contributor to the WordPress project, focussing primarily on designing Gutenberg. She also lead a team of over 25 community members in exploratory user research and usability studies.

Matt was the [Accessibility Lead for WordPress 5.0](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/03/a-plan-for-5-0/), one of the biggest WordPress releases in history, and worked to [improve WordPress' editing experience for _all users_](https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/10/18/regarding-accessibility-in-gutenberg/).

Matt also worked to drastically improve Gutenberg's end-to-end tests to prevent regressions and maintain a fast development pace.

## localForage

Matt is the author and co-maintainer of localForage, used in production on sites like [WordPress.com](http://wordpress.com/), [addons.mozilla.org](http://addons.mozilla.org/), and [mobile.twitter.com](http://mobile.twitter.com/). localForage greatly simplifies offline storage for web developers and app developers who use JavaScript.

## Nebula Streaming Service

Developed the entire web infrastructure for the [Nebula streaming service](https://watchnebula.com), a paid video streaming service from [Standard Broadcast creators](https://standard.tv/). Using a barebones video backend service, Matt planned, created, and ran the entire infrastructure needed for the Nebula web app and iOS app—a Django API, a server-rendered React app, Stripe integration, and a Kubernetes cluster on AWS—all in six months.
