## Get in touch

[photo of us together][photo of Edinburgh?]

We're based in beautiful Edinburgh, Scotland, but we work remotely for clients around the world. If we respond to your email at 1am that's our excuse—sometimes we keep odd hours.

The best way to get in touch with us is [via email (hello@octopusthink.com)](mailto:hello@octopusthink.com), but you can also follow us on various forms of social media if you just want to keep tabs on what we're up to.

### Sign up for our newsletter

We send out emails around once a quarter with highlights of what we've been up to, what we're doing next, apps and tools we've built, and things we've found to make your life easier. You can unsubscribe at any time and we'll never try to aggressively sell you something, partly because we're just not that sales-y. We'll also never sell your information to anyone else, especially if they *are* sales-y.
