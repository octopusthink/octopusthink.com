Technology should be honest, thoughtful, and pleasant to use. More than that, it should improve your life and reduce stress. We build products that solve real problems in an ethical way.

</IllustratedPoint>

<IllustratedPoint horizontal label={<Fragment>We <Strong>listen</Strong>.</Fragment>} illustration={ListenIllustration}>

We love hearing from users! We fix bugs fast and we plan our roadmap based on user feedback. We respond personally to every single support request. We can't always fix everything, but we'll do our best to try.

<IllustratedPoint horizontal label={<Fragment>We <Strong>respect</Strong> your privacy.</Fragment>} illustration={PrivacyIllustration}>

We never, ever sell your data or snoop on you. Metrics are used to make products better, not track you. We explain how we handle user data and require your explicit opt-in before obtaining it. You are not the product.
