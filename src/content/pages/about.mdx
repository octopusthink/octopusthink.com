## We **care** about stuff.

We believe that technology can be a tool to improve people's lives. As technology becomes more intertwined in our everyday lives, it becomes more important that we build products thoughtfully and empathically. Our mission is to leverage everything we've learned to make the world a little bit better‚Äîone website, app, or visualisation at a time.

We care deeply about making the world a better, fairer place, and we're not willing to compromise our values to make a quick quid. We make the most **ethical decisions** possible, from the projects we take on to the tools we use (sorry Monsanto, we're not interested). We work with governments so vital services are accessible and friendly and we leverage our experience with big companies to help small businesses realise big ideas.

## We don't do **busy work**.

Staying small allows us to be nimble and adapt easily. We get things done without getting bogged down in endless meetings or onerous administrative overhead. If we can take a boring task off your plate so you can direct your energy better‚Äîwe'll be delighted.

We love **automation and efficiency**, which is a thread that runs through all of our work. Want to talk about tooling and improving your workflows? We love that kind of thing, and it's evidenced in our best work.

## We get things **done**.

We've been on the Internet since MUDs and Mosaic. (Remember those? No? We do!) We've worked on a wide range of projects with clients of all sizes. We've built experiences for hundreds of **millions of users** across the world. We've contributed thousands of hours to major open-source software projects. We've spoken at conferences all over the world, and we've taught, mentored, and encouraged all sorts of different people along the way.

We eschew clever for **simple**, exclusive for **open**, and safety for **boldness**.
