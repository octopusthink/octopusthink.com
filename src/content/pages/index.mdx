## Who we are

We're a duo based in Scotland with three decades of **design and development** experience.

Matt is our Chief Technical Octopus, a software developer and vintage motorcycle enthusiast. Sarah is our Chief Design Octopus, a graphic and product designer with a penchant for bold colours and impractical footwear.

We don't take ourselves too seriously, but we do **great work**.

  Three PortfolioCards should output here, probably based on either numbers here or, if necessary, a flag in the portfolio items' frontmatter.

## Work with us

Our website is still under construction. That's why our friend Bubbles here is wearing a hard hatâ€”and why he's still in pencil-sketch format. More is coming soon, so stay tuned!

Have a project you'd like to discuss? Drop us a line for a **no-strings-attached** estimate.
