Hello there! We're Octopus Think, a duo based in Scotland with over three decades of combined software design, development, and DevOps experience.

We've worked on all kinds of projects with clients of all sizes: from the group-up rewrite of Firefox Add-ons to the redesign of WordPress' editor, we've designed, developed, and shipped awesome software to hundreds of millions of users across the world.

## Our values

Running a business and making enough money to afford MacBooks doesn't mean you need to compromise on the things you believe. We are advocates of inclusive design, fans of open source, and we believe that, ultimately, technology is a tool to make the world a better place.

Are you making the world a better place? We offer a 15% discount for non-profits, governments, and open-source work, so long as you aren't in league with Putin.

## Hire us

We're available to hire for your next design or development project; as either a part of your existing team or to build out your idea from scratch. Contact us now!
