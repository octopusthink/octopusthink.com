I have a lot of ideas, and I always want to do everything immediately. I talk too fast. Honestly, I’m not even great at waiting thirty minutes for dinner.</p><p>But living in Portugal has—sort of accidentally—taught me patience. Everything takes longer than I expect here. I’ve been working at renovating our garage bathroom for months—a task I claimed would be “cheap and fast” back in January—and I’m only just now ready to install the plasterboard walls.</p><p>There are many reasons it’s taken so long—I’ve been making it up as I go, the home centre is incapable of delivering anything on time, I already <em>have</em> a day job, and that one time a ceiling collapsed full of dry rot. But every time I have to push things back yet <em>again</em> and I think to myself how I could be done by now if I just didn’t bother building out that niche—I remember how badly things tend to go if I rush them needlessly.</p><p>I’m always grateful when I’ve taken the extra time to do a good job, no matter how painful it is to introduce <em>yet another delay</em> just because you have termites to deal with now too or you just really need a damned nap. (I really need a damned nap. And for my house to stop having major catastrophes on a weekly basis.)</p><h2>Moving fast breaks things</h2><p>And not to extrapolate too much, but I feel like this really applies to working in technology as well. Matt and I have both worked in tech for long enough to get pretty jaded. There’s a lot to love about the tech industry, but there’s also a whole lot that’s broken about it too, and that has serious knock-on effects for the world at large.</p><p>Tech has long proclaimed the virtue of “moving fast and breaking things”, a concept popularised by Facebook—a company known for their upstanding morals and innovative design (…right?) That’s all well and good when all that you’re breaking is your own servers, but it’s just wilful ignorance to claim that’s as far as technology reaches into our lives.</p><h2>Be NASA, not Facebook</h2><p>Instead of moving fast and breaking things, we aim to <strong>move thoughtfully and fix things</strong>. We don’t want to be Facebook. We want to be <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90449853/this-woman-knows-the-secret-to-fixing-big-techs-most-pervasive-problem?partner=rss&amp;utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=rss+fastcompany&amp;utm_content=rss?cid=search">Margaret Hamilton</a>, the absolute conker of a woman who sent a rocket to the fucking <em>moon</em> without a single bug, way before Facebook decided to destroy the fabric of society.</p><p>It’s easy to be impatient—I get it. But it’s so easy to fall into the trap of responding to everything with a kneejerk reaction and failing to follow through, especially with a twenty-four hour news cycle and <a href="https://nickpunt.com/blog/deescalating-social-media/">social media that rewards us for talking</a>—not for listening.</p><h2>What we’re up to now</h2><p>So right now, we’re taking our time, and trying to be thoughtful. Things aren’t moving as fast as I’d like, but I hope that means we’re doing better, more thoughtful work that actually helps people.</p><p>We’re currently hard at work on <a href="https://turniptimer.com">Turnip</a>, our timer for freelancers and other people who need to track the time they spend working on projects. We’ve been using an internal version ourselves for over a year now, and it’s <em>almost</em> ready for its beta—but not quite. We’d been hoping for an April release, but then our ceiling caved in and now it might be more like May.</p><p>Somewhere along the line I wound up completely redesigning the interface and branding (we’re not even at a beta yet and it’s already on its third logo), and Matt completely overhauled the technical architecture. I’m not even sure it’s the same thing we started working on a year ago, at our hack weekend to Aberdeen we cancelled two days before the first UK lockdown started, because it seemed irresponsible to go anywhere.</p><p>But I’m sure it will be better, and that’s something that my impatient heart can wait for.</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2021-03-31-on-moving-slowly-and-not-breaking-things</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2021-03-31-on-moving-slowly-and-not-breaking-things</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah London Semark]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 31 Mar 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Hooray! Everything is terrible.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I hate to admit this, but I’m a glass half empty kind of girl. For a long time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide"><em>Candide</em></a> was my favourite book. Some days I wake up feeling like something terrible is going to happen. I keep my expectations tempered. I’d rather be suprised when things go right than gutted when they don’t.</p><p>I’d like to be more optimistic. Optimists <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/37/18357">live longer</a>, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022399907002917?via%3Dihub">make better choices</a>, are more <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/the-athletes-way/201307/optimism-stabilizes-cortisol-levels-and-lowers-stress">resilient against psychological stressors</a>, and just generally handle their shit better. But optimism is one of those things that’s baked into your genes and your history, and whilst you <em>can</em>, apparently, become more optimistic, most of us are wired a certain way and tend to stay there. So I guess I’m kind of a pessimist.</p><p>Matt, on the other hand, is the quintessential optimist—a bouncing, joyful golden retriever for whom every day is sunny, even if it’s raining out.</p><p>This difference between us has been especially prominent over the last year, as the world has been increasingly chaotic. I was convinced there’d be no more travel for a long time (points me) and Matt would swear a vaccine would be available soon (points Matt).</p><p>In many ways, we’re polar opposites who approach the world through entirely different lenses. He’s calm whilst I’m exuberant verging on manic. I like building things, he takes pleasure in using a demolition hammer. He tends to focus on details whilst I’m more conceptual. I love starting projects and he likes to actually finish them.</p><p>Before we started Octopus Think, I spent eight years running a business solo, and it would have been extremely challenging for me to imagine ever having shared responsibility and control of the business with another human being.</p><p>But Matt and I have been doing this thing together for over a year now, whilst living basically in the same room, 24/7, and we just don’t clash that often.</p><p>It’s these different outlooks that really mean we work well together—both personally and professionally. We have many complementary skills, but we don’t really have a huge amount of overlap. Together, we cover a lot of ground without really butting heads. We intersect just enough to have a shared understanding of what we’re working toward.</p><p>And in the areas where our Venn diagrams connect, there tends to be a clear sense of ownership. For instance, I know some JavaScript (my chart above is a lie), but this is so clearly Matt’s domain that I don’t feel the need to argue with him if he tells me I’m doing something wrong. (He’s making what I can only assume are <span title="Editor&#x27;s note: props to you for this one.">React jokes</span> as I write this, but they aren’t very funny.)</p><p>We spend a ridiculous amount of time discussing everything in great detail, from how we spend the business’ money to how we design an interface. We often go on long walks and discuss some aspect of what we’re working on. By the time we get back—often hours later—we both have a more nuanced understanding of the problem we’re trying to solve, and how to solve it. I call these “arguments”, but Matt—ever the semantic nitpicker—warns me that makes it sound like we’re bickering. He calls them “debates” or “discussions”. Sure. 😉</p><p>Whatever you call them, they’re critical to us working well together. We come to better conclusions in spite of what might be otherwise limited experience, because we’re considering a wider breadth of perspective than either of us could do alone. This is likely part of why <a href="https://www.bcg.com/publications/2017/people-organization-leadership-talent-innovation-through-diversity-mix-that-matters">diverse teams perform better</a>. It’s also why, were we ever in the position to hire someone, we’d prioritise someone whose lived experience was far from our own. (Yet another subject discussed via a long walk.)</p><p>So when my inherent pessimism collides with Matt’s unbridled optimism, I think it actually gives us a more complete, more nuanced outlook on the world.</p><p>Together, we’re uplifted enough to imagine a better future, to drive toward new work, and to continue forging ahead even when things get difficult—but we’re also critical enough to identify when something isn’t working, when we need to reconsider an approach, or when a decision could potentially cause harm. I used to refer to us, together, as a <em>cautious optimist</em>. I think a better term might be a <em>critical</em> optimist.</p><p><strong>There’s no time like the present for critical optimism.</strong> There are signals that maybe, just maybe, the world is turning a number of corners toward a better future—but we also need to be mindful of all the forces that got us here in the first place. <em>Especially</em> those of us working in technology.</p><p>It might be the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Best_of_all_possible_worlds">best of all possible worlds</a>… but let’s really examine it critically first, just to be sure, okay?</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2021-02-02-hooray-everything-is-terrible</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2021-02-02-hooray-everything-is-terrible</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah London Semark]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 02 Feb 2021 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The year in review: 2020]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Every month, Matt and I have a “monthly summit”, which we schedule for the 8th at 8pm (we are really into the octopus theme, okay?). It may seem silly to have an “all-hands” when you’re two people living in the same house, but it’s really helpful to regularly review what we’ve done well—and what we haven’t.</p><p>I often think New Years’ lists are a bit played out. But I like the thought that, in ten years’ time, we’ll have an archive to look back on.</p><p>So, with that in mind—here’s some of the high (and low!) lights of this especially tumultuous year:</p><h2>🏚 We moved to Portugal (and bought an old house)</h2><p>We really didn’t intend to move during a pandemic—but Brexit meant that our time was running out for a project we’d been planning for years. When it seemed like things were at their calmest, we packed everything we could on Matt’s motorbike and drove through Scotland, England, Spain, and Portugal as quickly as we could. We spent nearly two whole days in a tiny room on the ferry, which was actually more pleasant than it sounds.</p><p>We wound up falling in love with an abandoned house from the 1700s that a local viscondessa had built for her servant/paramour, in a charming little village near some stunning hiking routes. The house needs a lot of love (there wasn’t even running water when we moved in), but we’re slowly working on bringing it back to life.</p><p>Learning Portuguese, making the house liveable, and dealing with mountains of paperwork, has consumed a great deal of our time and energy this year. Right now, we have running water and super-fast internet, but we’re still working on hot water and a functional roof. It’s an uphill battle, but Portugal is beautiful, the people are friendly, and there’s lots of pasteis de nata to keep us full of sugar energy while we demolish things. 😋</p><h2>🚀 We shipped our first app</h2><p>We released Mic Drop, our mic-muting app for Macs in early 2020, right after lockdowns started in earnest, which seemed like fortuitous timing.</p><p>It was <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/02/five-mac-apps-june-2020/">featured on MacRumors in June</a>, which lead to a giant spike in sales and was really cool! Releasing and supporting an app is an exhausting, but exhilarating, process. We’ve learnt so much about all sort of different things, from pricing and marketing an app (still not a major skillset) to dealing with oddities of macOS APIs.</p><p>Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, and doing all of our own support on a product we directly control has meant we’ve been able to fix bugs quickly and improve the app thoughtfully.</p><h2>😢 We didn’t ship as many apps as we wanted to</h2><p>Our original intention was to ship an app every quarter. That obviously hasn’t happened yet—we only shipped one (Mic Drop) and our second (Turnip) is nearly ready for beta. As it turns out, shipping even a super simple app is an absolute boatload of work, and everything took more time than we’d expected. We also spent a great deal of time on client work, volunteer work, and personal stuff (see: moving during a pandemic).</p><p>That’s okay—we’ll get faster in the future as we know more and have more infrastructure built up, and ultimately we’d much rather release fewer, higher-quality apps. We always want to take the time to be thoughtful about our decisions, and if that makes things take longer, that’s okay.</p><p>Hopefully next year we’ll be able to double our productivity and release <strong>two</strong>.</p><h2>🚧 We had our first (and only) hack weekend</h2><p>We’d planned to do hack weekends once a quarter. A great excuse to go visit a new place, get into a new headspace, and do some heads-down work on a new project (or really focus on improving an existing project!)</p><p>We planned our first for a long weekend in Aberdeen in March, and then very suddenly the UK went into lockdown and we couldn’t go anywhere. We stayed home instead and got lots of work done. It wasn’t quite what we’d envisioned, but we managed to build an alpha of Turnip that we’ve been using on our machines ever since.</p><p>Our hope for 2020 is for more of these focussed, intensive work sessions—even if we can only do them from our currently-unheated office.</p><h2>We launched 13 new client sites</h2><p>Our regular client work took up a lot of time this year—there was lots of work that needed doing! We worked with a number of different charitable organisations focused on providing relief to various sectors impacted by the pandemic and to promoting social justice.</p><p>We also <a href="https://www.scottishtecharmy.org/podcasts/episode-14">worked with the Scottish Tech Army</a> to design &amp; build <a href="https://opentexts.world">Open Texts</a>, a project from the National Library of Scotland dedicated to making the digital collections of public libraries around the world more accessible—basically a search engine for free books. We did this work for free as volunteers because it seemed an awesome project to be able to give our expertise to. It was a super fun project to work on, especially for booky creatures such as ourselves. (Mostly me. I have a book problem.)</p><h2>We started making charitable donations</h2><p>We released Mic Drop in April, right around where everyone was suddenly being forced to work remotely. The timing was accidental, but we were aware that we might benefit from that bump. Of course, we want our business to be successful, but that doesn’t mean holding onto every dollar whilst others are suffering.</p><p>So we decided to donate 50% of all Mic Drop revenues to charitable organisations impacted by the pandemic. We donated £667.60 donated to Scottish Women’s Aid and £306.38 to the Scottish Refugee Council, and we have one last cheque to make out once our numbers for Q4 are in.</p><p>For 2021, we’d like to continue this habit, but tying the values to our overall profits, rather than just a single product.</p><h2>Goals for next year</h2><p>We like to keep our goals measureable and concrete:</p><ul><li>Donate <strong>at least 1% of profits</strong> to charitable causes</li><li>Ship <strong>two</strong> new apps</li><li>Hold <strong>four</strong> hack weekends</li><li>Publish <strong>ten</strong> blog posts</li></ul><p>So this year, we didn’t accomplish all our goals, and that’s okay. We did make it out the other end in mostly one piece, and we strengthened our personal and professional relationships whilst laying groundwork for what we hope will be a better year to come.</p><p>Oh and hey, we managed to get our “year-in-review” post out before the year had technically ended this time, so that’s definitely progress. 😜</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-12-31-2020-year-in-review</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-12-31-2020-year-in-review</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah London Semark]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 31 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[A watched employee never boils]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I was on the hunt for a job when I found it. “Must install Time Doctor on computer,” it said. “Reports will be sent to your manager every week.”</p><p>Appalled, I closed the tab. Sure, I wanted a job, but there was no way I’d be willing to let my employer spy on me. Who would?</p><p>Fast-forward to today, where suddenly a whole lot of us are remote workers, whether we want to be or not. Remote work seems to be here to stay. But traditional employers, accustomed to being able to look over their employees’ shoulders constantly, aren’t <em>quite</em> ready to adopt to a new way of working.</p><p>Instead, they’re trying to be everywhere at once. Demanding your webcam be on all day. Scheduling multiple daily check-ins. Mandatory socialisation time. Requiring you install an app on your phone to track your movements. There’s a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/04/30/work-from-home-surveillance/">booming business in work surveillance apps</a>, and every one of them sounds horribly creepy and invasive: taking photos of your screen (or your face) every five seconds, logging your keystrokes, recording the apps and websites you use, and ranking you based on your “productivity”.</p><p>It’s 1984 out there. Employees, not surprisingly, are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/13/854014403/your-boss-is-watching-you-work-from-home-boom-leads-to-more-surveillance?t=1603999163810">stressed out</a>.</p><h2>The office may actually be more of a distraction</h2><p>Here’s the thing: if you’re worried someone won’t get any work done at home, don’t worry: <em>they don’t get any work done at the office either</em>.</p><p>Fun fact: the first (and last!) time I had an office job, I was guilty of at least once falling asleep at my desk. In an open office. Nobody ever noticed.</p><p>But it’s not just me being lazy! Office workers say they spend just <a href="https://www.vouchercloud.com/resources/office-worker-productivity">three hours a day</a> on productive work, and as much as three hours on <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1350508413515541">personal tasks</a>. (The rest is emails and meetings, which let’s not even get started on.)</p><p>Just because we’re sitting in the office doesn’t mean we’re working. We’re watching Tiger King, playing Angry Birds, emailing our friends, doomscrolling through Twitter, and even perusing porn. (Yep. A solid <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010880401800562">70% of traffic to porn sites happens during the day</a>.)</p><p>A <a href="https://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/brags/news-releases">recent survey of COVID-induced remote workers</a> actually shows that people are <em>more</em> productive when working from home and they experience almost half as many distractions as they do when in the office. Apparently your children are less disruptive than your coworkers.</p><h2>Hours ≠ results</h2><p>Our eight-hours-a-day model isn’t even the best way to get work done effectively.</p><p>Historically, we worked way more than 40 hours a week in manufacturing jobs. <a href="https://www.clockspot.com/blog/working-40-hour-week/">Working hours progressively tapered off</a> over the years, thanks to pressure from unions, until they landed at 40 hours in the 1930s and then… they just kinda got stuck there. Plenty of studies found that 8 hours a day was optimal to avoid burnout in manufacturing jobs, but we never bothered to update it for a shift to knowledge work, where we have <a href="https://www.salon.com/2012/03/14/bring_back_the_40_hour_work_week/">fewer productive hours in a day</a>.</p><p>Lots of historically productive people only worked <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/46/balance/darwin-was-a-slacker-and-you-should-be-too">a few hours a day</a>, spending the rest of their time going for walks, reading, or even napping.</p><p>Science backs them up. (Thanks, science!) A <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-295X.100.3.363">study of violin students</a> found that the best students weren’t those who put in more hours, but rather those who studied more deliberately, engaging fully rather than just slogging through hours. And it found that kind of deliberate study was best done in short bursts, followed by breaks—adding up to only four hours a day. Another study in the 1950s found that scientists were most productive when they worked 20 hours a week.</p><p>Numerous studies indicate that <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/16/Nothingness/how-to-waste-time-properly">wasting time</a> actually makes you more, not less, productive. As it turns out, rest and breaks are as integral to getting quality work done as time spent actively working.</p><h2>Maybe I’m just a slacker?</h2><p>Having spent most of my grown-up life as a freelancer, I’ve spent a lot of time closely tracking how I spend my time. Back when I was running my first business, I often worked sixty hour work weeks, in between club-hopping. (I didn’t sleep a lot.)</p><p>When I took a remote job, I stopped tracking my time, and switched to focussing on a healthier work-life balance. I’d work a few hours in the morning, when everything was quiet (working from Europe with primarily US-based colleagues makes for a really productive, focussed morning work session). Then I’d take a long break in the afternoon. I’d go play squash when the courts were empty, or pop to the shops when the queues were nonexistent. In the evening, I’d return to work and connect synchronously with coworkers.</p><p>Now, I find I struggle to work an eight-hour day with any regularity. I track my time pretty closely—if I’m working, there’s a timer running, but if I’m browsing shoes on the internet, I pause it. Some days I get on a roll and accidentally work 11 hours. But most of the time, I find myself actually <em>working</em> closer to an average of 25-30 hours a week.</p><h2>So what’s the solution?</h2><p><strong>Treat your employees like adults.</strong> Micro-managing, in any context, is actively detrimental to productivity, and it promotes a fear-based style of leadership. When <a href="https://www.15five.com/blog/employee-autonomy/">employees are given autonomy</a>, they’re happier, more engaged, and they often come up with better results. Bonus: they’re less likely to up and quit.</p><p><strong>Lead with trust.</strong> Rather than focussing on a model where employees are guilty by default, begin by extending full trust. (After all, you wouldn’t have hired them if you didn’t think they were great, right?) When people are handed responsibility, they’re more likely to rise to the challenge. If you lead by mistrusting them, they’re more likely to think of ways to subvert your surveillance system.</p><div></div><p><strong>Focus on outcomes, not time.</strong> There are lots of great reasons to track your time, but ultimately, time just isn’t a great measure of what someone’s actually doing. Instead, try to focus on what they’ve accomplished. OKRs (objectives and key results) are one way of doing this, but there are lots of structured approaches to measure employee productivity in a non-time-based way. Rather than doing yearly check-ins, check in more frequently in order to nip any problems in the bud.</p><p><strong>Encourage breaks.</strong> This may sound counter-productive, but the actual danger of remote working is never being able to turn off. As the boundaries between work and home blur, it becomes easier to overwork, or check in constantly, which can actually be counter-productive. Encourage employees to take breaks and work when they’re most productive. If necessary, have “on-call” times when everyone’s expected to be around. But recognise that workers will often be more productive (and happier!) if they can take breaks during the day, or if they can fit work around their schedules.</p><p>…and what if you’re an employee, hit by some draconian measures?</p><p>Hit us up, we can write you a bot to make it look like you’re working. 😎</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-10-31-a-watched-employee-never-boils</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-10-31-a-watched-employee-never-boils</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah London Semark]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 31 Oct 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to mute a mic in six months]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>There’s an undeniable appeal in simplicity, especially as technology feels increasingly complex. The products we love the most are often the ones that feel the simplest, even if they aren’t necessarily the ones that do the least.</p><p>From a consumer perspective, this often creates something of a paradox—when an app <em>feels</em> simple, we think that it must have been simple to build, but often, the inverse is true. Building an app that feels simple for users can often require more work under the hood than it would to build a more complex app, because we’re managing that complexity in the code, rather than asking the user to handle that complexity for us.</p><p>That’s good for users—but not so great for us, when we just wanna ship our damned app! 😅</p><h2>If I had more time, I’d write a shorter letter</h2><p><a href="https://getmicdrop.com/">Mic Drop</a> is a macOS menubar app that allows you to mute and unmute your microphone with a keyboard shortcut. The goal of the app is to provide a customisable, easy, and reliable way to control your microphone in remote meetings and calls.</p><p>Mic Drop’s core functionality—muting the microphone—is <strong>simple to describe but complex to implement</strong>. It’s the perfect example of developer hubris: ”<em>Easy. I could build it in a week!</em>” That’s what I thought too.</p><p>In November. (Note: We <a href="/blog/2020-04-29-say-hello-to-mic-drop">released Mic Drop</a> in April.) 😅</p><p>To mute the microphone, Mic Drop relies on macOS’s Core Audio framework. It’s a set of APIs that controls low-level audio device functionality on Macs. It’s been around for a long time, and as a result it’s pretty complex and certainly very-edge-case-y.</p><p>It turns out managing inputs like microphones is much more complicated than we thought! From aggregate inputs and loopback devices, not every input device is a real microphone. There are microphones that ignore mute settings, and some that claim to honour mute status but <em>don’t</em>. (I’m looking at you, LG UltraFine 5K.)</p><p>There’s a whole lot of code for handling edge cases in Mic Drop!</p><h2>Let’s not reinvent the wheel</h2><p>We built on top of existing open-source libraries to handle <a href="https://github.com/octopusthink/KeyHolder">recording keyboard shortcuts</a>. We’ve shared these <a href="https://github.com/octopusthink/Magnet">customised versions</a> of these libraries so you can use them in your own projects.</p><p>We published an <a href="https://getmicdrop.com/under-the-hood/">Under the Hood</a> page on the Mic Drop website. This is something we’ll be doing for all future apps—partly because we’re curious, and partly because we’re fans of transparency. It allows us an opportunity to explain our choices and gives others a reference for their own projects. 📕</p><p>It turns out it’s one of the most popular pages on the Mic Drop website, so either people are curious or they’re finding it useful. We’ll definitely stick with the habit.</p><p>We’re also using <a href="https://appcenter.ms">Microsoft’s App Center</a> to log (anonymous!) usage stats and crash metrics for users who opt-in. It’s easy to use, and comes with a dead-simple API for logging events in the app. I’d recommend it! 👍🏻</p><h2>On macOS—and the Mac App Store</h2><p>We’re web people at heart, and though we’ve made iOS and Android apps in the past, this is the first macOS app we’ve shipped. It’s also the first app we sold via the Mac App Store.</p><p>At first, we weren’t even sure if we would ship Mic Drop to the Mac App Store—but I’m glad we did.</p><p>It’s frustrating to be paying \$99/year and 30% to Apple—a company famed for their excellent user experience—and then have Apple’s review process block us from shipping bug fixes to users, sometimes for lengthy periods of time. 😤</p><p>I know App Store review times have improved a good deal, but the unnecessary opaqueness of the process and the comparison to the ease of self-publishing updates is a needless frustration.</p><p>That said: we can’t deny that the Mac App Store has benefitted app sales. This month Mic Drop has made about 50% of its revenue via the App Store, and we get some sales from organic searches via the app store.</p><h2>Singing to myself</h2><p>Building an audio app makes for some strange development habits. Sometimes I sing into the microphone with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_meter">VU meter</a> open to see if the mute is working. Sarah has just learnt to ignore the chorus of “Do do do dee dee do dee” streaming from the office. 🎶</p><p>There was a bug related to a menubar API when multiple monitors were used with a MacBook screen open. Since I have a single-monitor setup at my desk, I had to get creative to reproduce the issue:</p><div></div><p>So many Vespas! 🛵 (Including on my coffee cup.)</p><h2>Hardware is <em>hard</em></h2><p>Testing meeting software is easy. Most meeting apps have a free version we can test with.</p><p>But not all audio hardware behaves consistently, and it’s a real pain to diagnose issues without the hardware on hand. A lot of the hardware people write in about is expensive and niche, so it’s often quite costly to test an issue for one user. We try really hard to offer great support, but the maths on that is tricky—a £500 device for a £4 sale (of which we’re donating £2, and the taxman takes nearly £1) is the kind of business practise that makes our accountant give us long lectures.</p><p>I won’t lie: we’ve (ab)used generous return policies a few times, because we don’t personally have much use for a £500+ USB-XLR Audio interface after we’ve debugged its issues. 😆</p><h2>Betas are the best</h2><p>I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention some of the awesome and creative users we’ve met during Mic Drop’s early development. ❤️</p><p>This was our first Mac app and we’re a young company, so our beta group was pretty small. But those users provided really excellent feedback. Even if your beta group is tiny, it’s worth doing to get any feedback you can and ensure your app works for people before you ship it to the world!</p><p>One of our beta users (hi Enrique! 👋🏻) shared feedback that, after some discussion with Sarah, led to the status window feature. I was skeptical at first, but it’s turned out to be a very popular feature. Heck, even I use it now! 🙃</p><p>Another user was building an Arduino-powered “On Air” light switch to hook up to a keyboard shortcut for Mic Drop. Pretty cool! (Send photos, please!) 💡</p><h2>Greener pastures (in defense of the web)</h2><p>I often hear developers bemoan the amount of technology needed to build even a simple “Hello world” web app. From transpiling ES6 with Babel to managing assets with Webpack: there’s a <em>lot</em> to learn to make a good website these days. Gone are the days of “write some HTML, CSS, and maybe some jQuery” to build a website or an HTML app. But it’s backward to observe this trend and proclaim: <em>The web is getting too complex because the build systems are complex!</em> The reality is those build systems are evolving at the same rate as the web itself, which can do a lot more than it could it the days of jQuery 1.0.</p><p>Venture into Xcode and you’ll observe the same sort of complexity. Except it’s obscured by an IDE and a lack of open-source code. Say what you will about the web, but you can always go to the source if needed—and with the functional and modular approach more build tools and libraries are taking, you aren’t locked into a development paradigm like you were in the days of WordPress or Rails. Conversely, Xcode and the Apple toolchain are pretty much the only way to build a macOS app aside from Electron.</p><p>All of this is just to say that the grass is always greener. Xcode can be frustrating, opaque, and restrictive. It comes a steep learning curve. I had plenty of “oh, cool!” moments building Mic Drop, but my frustrations with Xcode were similar to the frustrations I encounter with any new tool. 🤷🏻‍♂️</p><h2>Once more unto the breach</h2><p>After all that: would we do it all over again? We sure would! In fact: we’ve already started!</p><p>We’re currently busy working on another menu bar app, except this one will be for both macOS and Windows. It’s a timer app, for freelancers and other people who need to track the time they spend working on projects. It’s currently especially designed for users of FreeAgent, but we’re planning other integrations and a standalone version as well.</p><p>If you want to hear more about it sign up for our newsletter (at the bottom of the page) or <a href="https://twitter.com/octopusthink">follow us on Twitter</a> to get notified when we start the beta!</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-08-12-how-to-mute-a-mic-in-six-months</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-08-12-how-to-mute-a-mic-in-six-months</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Matthew Riley MacPherson]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Wed, 12 Aug 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[The Remote Meeting Etiquette Guide]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Matt and I have been working remotely for over a decade, so we’ve seen it all when it comes to video call snafus. Want to ace your video meetings and nab that promotion? Follow our simple guide!</p><h2>1. Always wear bottoms.</h2><p>Hey, we get it. Your co-workers can only see you from the waist up. Why not, right? Nobody will ever know the difference!</p><p><strong>Wrong.</strong></p><div></div><p>This is just a risk you don’t need to take. Put some trousers on, please!</p><h2>2. Send your lover(s) packing.</h2><p>Ideally, you’re going to want to keep your unintentional nudes to a strict minimum.</p><div></div><p>If you happen to be stepping out on a significant other who isn’t cool with it, maybe that “strict minimum” should be closer to “zero”.</p><h2>3. Make sure your decor is appropriate.</h2><p>Matt worked with someone for several years who continually attended video calls with… “erotic” art behind him, always in frame. Not to be a prude, but maybe leave that for the after-work social video call.</p><div></div><p>Hot tip: your pre-meeting prep should always include opening up Photo Booth (or some other camera app) and checking to see what’s in frame. This is also an excellent opportunity to make sure your hair looks good and you aren’t at a super weird angle. (I like to prop my laptop up on a pile of cookbooks so it’s aimed straight at my face, rather than angled up like I’m some sort of demi-god. YMMV.)</p><h2>4. Lock your door.</h2><p>Children: life’s little <a href="(https://www.theguardian.com/media/video/2017/mar/10/bbc-correspondent-interrupted-by-his-children-live-on-air-video)">embarrassing moment</a> machines.</p><div></div><h2>5. Turn off your mic before cussing out your colleagues.</h2><p>Or, you know, don’t cuss them out at all, but apparently that doesn’t work for everyone.</p><div></div><p>Always remember: the internet is forever, and there’s a good chance that if you act like a jackass, the internet will reward you by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaughan_Gething#Zoom_incident">immortalising the incident</a> on your otherwise relatively scant Wikipedia page.</p><h2>6. Drinking is fine. Just use a mug.</h2><p>Because nothing says classy like a mug full of wine.</p><div></div><p>Maybe wait until after the meeting to hit up your bong, though.</p><h2>7. Mute your mic!</h2><div></div><p>If you want to mute your mic super fast, or see an indicator during your meetings, we even wrote an app for that! If you’re using a Mac, <a href="https://getmicdrop.com/?coupon=WORK_FROM_HOME">Mic Drop mutes your mic from any app</a>. (Use the code <code>WORK_FROM_HOME</code> to get 20% off.)</p><h2>8. Never apologise for your pets.</h2><p>Not everyone will find your screaming children charming, but I guarantee that everyone will find your cat an absolute <em>delight</em>.</p><div></div><p>We’d <em>all</em> rather be watching cat videos than doing this meeting. 🐈</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-06-30-remote-meeting-etiquette-guide</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-06-30-remote-meeting-etiquette-guide</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah London Semark]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 30 Jun 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Say hello to Mic Drop!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Sarah and I have been working from home for ages—think since “Umbrella” was playing in every bar and radio station. (Back when people listened to radio stations!) As a lot of people are discovering, this means spending a lot of time in video chats.</p><p>From weekly stand-ups to user research interviews, strategy sessions to pair programming—<strong>we spend a <em>lot</em> of time in meetings</strong>.</p><p>Inevitably, this leads to a chorus of “Can you hear me?” “Is this thing on?” It means scrambling for the mute button in Zoom, Google Meet, Slack, Skype, and countless other apps to make sure we aren’t distracting everyone else on the call by taking a swig of tea or banging away on our “quiet” mechanical keyboards. Almost every single day, I wind up in a meeting with someone silently mouthing words at their screen, and I have to interrupt them with a “Sorry, you’re muted!”</p><p>Muting yourself is critical to keeping a video call running smoothly, but it’s too easy to get it wrong. And when you get it wrong, that can have <a href="https://twitter.com/Alain_Tolhurst/status/1252987811751436293">very real consequences</a>. 🙊</p><h2>We built an app to help.</h2><p>Mic Drop is a super-simple Mac app to help you quickly mute (and then unmute!) your microphone. It’s designed for remote workers, user researchers, teachers, podcasters… really, anyone spending as much time in video calls as we do!</p><div css="[object Object]"><iframe width="100%" height="320" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8bYAgjUQHys" frameBorder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p>Using a video app’s native mute function is an inconsistent experience, and existing Mac apps that handle muting tend to be buggy, outdated, and unsupported.</p><p>We wanted a simple app that did a few things really well:</p><ul><li>Shows your mute status in the Mac menu bar.</li><li>Allows you to set a global keyboard shortcut that mutes your mic in <em>every</em> app.</li><li>Supports mute toggle, push-to-talk, and push-to-mute.</li><li>Keeps track of <em>all</em> of your devices.</li></ul><p>That last one is a big one if you travel and do meetings with wireless headphones. If you’re halfway through your meeting and your AirPods die, your laptop mic won’t suddenly activate when your headphones disconnect, leaving your colleagues wondering who’s loudly cursing whilst trying to find another set of headphones during the meeting. (True story.)</p><h2>How does it work?</h2><p>Mic Drop allows you to record a custom keyboard shortcut to toggle your microphone. You can use it anytime—in any app—to mute or unmute your microphone. No matter what you’re doing, it <em>just works</em>.</p><p>It keeps track of your input devices to make sure they’re muted, but Mic Drop <strong>never listens to you</strong> or records your input. And since Mic Drop mutes your mic on a system level, it’s also a handy way to prevent apps from listening to you in the background, if you’re worried that sort of thing. 🕵🏻‍♂️</p><p>Curious about what’s under the hood? We wrote a little more about <a href="https://getmicdrop.com/under-the-hood/?pk_campaign=octopusthink&amp;pk_kwd=octopusthoughts">how it works</a>.</p><h2>Why do I need this?</h2><p>Unlike the fancy microphones you find in office meeting rooms, our laptop, headset, and webcam microphones pick up a lot of background noise. It’s considerate to mute your mic on calls—especially if you’re in a busy place or you share a home with small children / large canines / a smoke alarm that goes off every time your partner tries to cook a chicken breast. (Also a true story.)</p><p>Mic Drop makes it really easy to see if you’re muted or not, and to toggle your mic super quickly. Even if you only use one app for your meetings, with Mic Drop that app doesn’t need to be in focus for you to toggle your mute settings. That’s super helpful if you’re the note-taker, or if you’re just distracted and looking at kitten videos on the internet. 🤫 (Definitely not a true story.)</p><h2>Did you make this because of COVID-19?</h2><p>Nope! We started working on Mic Drop last November during a weekend in Luxembourg, back before the pandemic hit. We didn’t rush to launch in order to capitalise on the crisis because a) that seems super icky and b) we wanted to be sure everything was well-tested and bulletproof prior to launch.</p><p>But we recognise that this global crisis means that a whole lot of people are working from home now. In light of that, we’ll be <strong>donating 50% of every sale</strong> to charity for the entirety of 2020.</p><p>Lockdown measures mean many of us are spending more time at home. This has very real consequences for those who experience domestic abuse.</p><p>That’s why we’re donating 50% of every sale (that’s <em>revenues</em>, not profits!) to <a href="https://womensaid.scot/covid-19/">Scottish Women’s Aid</a>.</p><h2>Sounds good—how can I get it?</h2><p>You can learn more (or download a free trial) at <a href="https://getmicdrop.com/?pk_campaign=octopusthink&amp;pk_kwd=octopusthoughts">getmicdrop.com</a>. The free trial gives you full functionality for thirty days, so you’ll have lots of time to try it out.</p><p>If you find it useful, you can purchase Mic Drop for a one-time fee of \$6.99/£6.99/7.99€. It’s available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/mic-drop/id1489816366">Mac App Store</a> or directly from the <a href="https://getmicdrop.com/?pk_campaign=octopusthink&amp;pk_kwd=octopusthoughts">Mic Drop website</a>.</p><p>We’ll also be giving away occasional free copies of the app over on our Twitter page, so follow <a href="https://twitter.com/octopusthink">@octopusthink</a> if you want to snag a promo code.

So let’s hop on that bandwagon and take a look at the year that passed: our successes, our failures, and what we hope a fresh new decade brings.</p><h2>What we learnt</h2><p>I learnt the basics of <strong>data analysis in Python</strong>! There’s a lot of boring stuff to trudge through, but it’s helping me both contextualise data when I come across it. If nothing else, it’s making me write better JavaScript, which makes Matt happy. I’m hoping it leads to more exciting work, like making impactful data visualisations and finally teaching a machine to design a website, my personal Moby Dick.</p><p>We both learnt how to build <strong>Gatsby sites</strong> (and made quite a few). Alongside this, we learnt CSS-in-JS (yes!), MDX (double yes!), and GraphQL (mixed feelings).</p><p>We both learnt a lot about <strong>design systems</strong> and started thinking about our work in more systematic ways. This codifies our work and helps us be more independent. Matt can get something scaffolded without waiting for my mockups, and I can build a React app using our existing components if he’s busy.</p><p>Just as the year closed, I started learning <strong>Portuguese.</strong> This means my Portuguese can fall back to Spanish, which in turn tends to fall back to French, so I look forward to being a confusing jumble of Romance languages for the next year.</p><h2>What we read</h2><p>We’re big fans of reading to expand your worldview and hone your empathy, so we try to read a lot in a year. (Check out <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/1074071">Sarah’s 2019 reads</a> and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/year_in_books/2019/74561969">Matt’s 2019 reads</a>). Here’s what we loved and would recommend in the non-fiction department:</p><h2>What we accomplished</h2><p>We <a href="http://localhost:8000/blog/2019-09-21-introducing-octopus-think">launched Octopus Think</a>. 🎊</p><p>We both <strong>took breaks</strong> and have become much more intentional about the work we take on and the time we make available.</p><p>We spent a lot of time <strong>thinking deeply</strong> (and arguing!) about <a href="https://octopusthink.com/blog/2019-11-22-ethics-at-the-heart-of-business">our ethics</a> and about how we want to run a business.</p><p>We <strong>established our brand</strong> (twice!) and started doing the social media thing.</p><p>We established a rhythm and cadence to our monthly meetings, set up <strong>metrics for tracking business performance,</strong> and defined ways of <strong>prioritising and measuring potential project ideas</strong> (all of which we’ll share in the future!)</p><p>We set up relationships for <strong>long-term, predictable work</strong> that helps sustain our business and allows us to experiment with self-directed projects. This basically sets us up to be able to work on new products without requiring VC funding, which we’re just not into.</p><h2>What we shipped</h2><h3>octopusthink.com</h3><p>In July, this website looked like this:</p><p>I know, right? Now, it looks like this:</p><p>It’s still not finished, but it’s come a long way.</p><h3>funfactsaboutoctopus.es</h3><p>This was a fun little side project we put together for World Octopus Day, because we’re whimsical like that, and who doesn’t love a strange biological and/or cultural fact?</p><a href="https://funfactaboutoctopus.es" class="css-0"></a><p>I write a new octopus fact on the 8th of the month (…ish) and I learn something new and interesting every time.</p><h3>Nebula</h3><p>Matt worked with Standard on a streaming video service and it launched early this year to much fanfare. Though he isn’t involved in the project after its initial launch, we keep tabs on its progress and it’s going quite well.</p><a href="https://watchnebula.com/" class="css-0"></a><p>Outside of that, we worked on all sorts of client projects, from working with 10up on Google’s Site Kit plugin for WordPress to book covers for a mystery series.</p><h3>Design &amp; development tools</h3><p>We’re both huge fans of building tools for designers and developers, mostly because we like to scratch our own itches. This year, we kicked off both a <strong>design system</strong> (<a href="https://nautilus.octopusthink.com">Nautilus</a>) and a <strong>Gatsby starter theme</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/octopusthink/ghost-ship">Ghost Ship</a>). These aren’t production-ready yet, but they’re far enough along that we can use them for our own work, which in turn allows us to see where the systems could be improved.</p><h3>What else?</h3><p>We have two new products in development that aren’t quite launch-ready yet. Updates on these soon!</p><h2>Where we fell short</h2><p>What didn’t we do?</p><p>I had a bullet point for this section that just says “Didn’t get as much done as I might have hoped.”, which Matt summarily crossed out, commenting “What does this even mean? Remove it!” It’s easy to fall into the trap of the never-ending to-do list, but there are a few things I wish we’d done better.</p><p>Namely, we still haven’t finished our portfolio (this takes <em>forever</em>) and our website still features a constructopus and a “under construction” notice on the homepage:</p><p>We also got a bit distracted from Nautilus work. Earlier in the year, we were doing monthly releases, but work has gotten stalled. That’s okay; we’ll loop back once we’ve cleared a few more pressing things from our plate.</p><p>I spent some time working on an accessible colour palette app that proved more challenging than expected, and that stalled out too. I’d really like to get that working though—if only to make it easier for <em>me</em> to make palettes in a more programmatic way—so I may dedicate a weekend to it once schedules are a bit more clear.</p><p>Finally, our social media presence could definitely be more engaged and/or engaging. Neither of us is particularly active on or enamoured with social media, so we’re not sure of the best strategy here just yet. That may come more organically with time, as we get into the groove of running a business. It’s still early yet!</p><h2>What we’re looking forward to next year!</h2><p>Turning a fresh page is always an exciting opportunity for new growth, development, and learning. Now we have a methodology for evaluating and assessing project ideas, we’ll be aiming to break them down into manageable chunks and <strong>shipping one new project</strong> (or feature!) every quarter.</p><p>To maintain a sense of momentum and accomplishment, we’ll also be doing getaway hack weekends once a quarter, in which we explore a new place and build a new thing. (Look for a future blog post once we’ve tried this and see how it works!)</p><p>Ultimately, our hopes for 2020 is that, having spent a lot of 2019 setting foundations, we’ll be able to start focussing on more exciting work—we have lots up our sleeve! 🎩</p><p>If nothing else, perhaps we’ll have our ducks in a row next year, and we’ll manage to publish a year-in-review post before the year has actually, you know, closed out. One can only dream! 😘</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-01-13-2019-year-in-review</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2020-01-13-2019-year-in-review</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah London Semark]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 13 Jan 2020 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Making ethics the beating heart(s) of our business]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>One sunny morning earlier this year, Matt and I made a giant pot of Chemex and conducted a series of exercises to determine our brand. Covering our newly-tiled kitchen walls with post-it notes helped us better understand our shared values, priorities, and motivators. A theme that kept coming up was ethics.</p><p>We’ve both spent a long time working for big tech companies, watching technology become more interwoven in people’s everyday lives. Many of these changes are improvements for the better, but others have the potential to create harm. The tech industry often gets so excited about what we <em>can</em> do that we sometimes don’t stop to ask ourselves if we <em>should</em> do it.</p><p>We want to make the tech industry a more diverse and ethical place. We genuinely believe that <strong>technology is a tool to improve people’s lives</strong>, and that it’s more and more important that we wield it carefully, thoughtfully, and deliberately.</p><p>It’s all well and good saying we care about ethics, or signing whatever pledge might be making the rounds this week, or putting a <strong>#TechForGood</strong> hashtag on all our tweets. But if we don’t back that up with a clear and concrete declaration of what that actually means in practise, it’s just <em>ethics-washing</em>. (I made that up right now. Feel free to use it.)</p><p>So we’ve established some guidelines for what our ethics are and what that means in practise. And we’re making it public, because that keeps us accountable.</p><p>These <strong>ethical stances underpin every decision</strong> we make. It means we have long discussions about the suppliers and services we use. It means we balance cost and features with impact on the world. We aren’t ascetic about it, but we aim to make the best decisions possible. We don’t do anything without thinking about it.</p><p>Three is a lovely auspicious number. There’s three wishes, three little pigs, three musketeers, a holy trinity (or two), three witches, three Fates—and it’s a helpful number for making things beautiful, balanced, or hilarious, as seen by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_thirds">the rule of thirds</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(writing)">the rule of three</a>, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three">any other three-rule</a>.</p><p><a href="https://funfactsaboutoctopus.es/three-hearts">Octopuses have three hearts</a>, so we do too. (Metaphorically, of course.)</p><style data-emotion-css="2gdgt6">.css-2gdgt6{border:0;-webkit-clip-path:rect(0 0 0 0);clip-path:rect(0 0 0 0);-webkit-clip-path:inset(50%);clip-path:inset(50%);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;white-space:nowrap;width:1px;}</style><span class="css-2gdgt6"><h2>Inclusion</h2></span><p><strong>Inclusion is at the core of everything that we do.</strong> Technology has the power to be a social equaliser, but often new technical developments can serve to exclude, isolate, or silence people. Using historically corrupted data to teach a machine leads to a computer that’s just as racist (or sexist, or ableist, or homophobic…) as history. We want to stop taking the “easy” route and instead think about the impact we have. This shit <em>matters</em>.</p><p>In practise, this means always thinking about the different types of users who will be affected by our technical decisions. We use persona spectrums and consequence mapping. We design with accessibility at the forefront. We aren’t rigid about how we ask for user’s personal information, and we only ask when we have a good reason to do so. <a href="https://nautilus.octopusthink.com/">Our design system</a> is rooted in inclusive principles and features accessible components—it’s also open source, so others can build on our work.</p><style data-emotion-css="2gdgt6">.css-2gdgt6{border:0;-webkit-clip-path:rect(0 0 0 0);clip-path:rect(0 0 0 0);-webkit-clip-path:inset(50%);clip-path:inset(50%);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;white-space:nowrap;width:1px;}</style><span class="css-2gdgt6"><h2>Respect</h2></span><p>Respect means treating our users, clients, and anyone who our technology reaches <strong>the way we’d like to be treated</strong>.</p><p>In practise, this means we avoid designing or implementing dark patterns. We put users’ privacy and security at the forefront. We don’t trick, coerce, or manipulate people. We ask for permission and are clear about how we’re using any data you’ve chosen to entrust us with. We are open and transparent in everything we do, and how everything we build works. We don’t take VC funding and instead bootstrap our work, ensuring our sole responsibility is to our customers.</p><style data-emotion-css="2gdgt6">.css-2gdgt6{border:0;-webkit-clip-path:rect(0 0 0 0);clip-path:rect(0 0 0 0);-webkit-clip-path:inset(50%);clip-path:inset(50%);height:1px;margin:-1px;overflow:hidden;padding:0;position:absolute;white-space:nowrap;width:1px;}</style><span class="css-2gdgt6"><h2>Sustainability</h2></span><p>When we think of sustainability, we think of both <strong>environmental and economic resilience</strong>. This widens our scope and allows us to think more broadly about how our business impacts the world we all inhabit. How are our individual choices, on both a personal and a profession level, impacting the world at large? Are we following campground rules?</p><p>In practise, this means we’ve built a sustainable business model based on controlled and deliberate growth. We pay our taxes. Our primary responsibility is to our customers, not shareholders. We don’t take work with Halliburton, Goldman Sachs, or Enron (not that they’re offering).</p><p>We consider the environmental impact of our work. We’re evaluating options for greener hosting and our VPS uses renewable energy. We build sites to be as performant as possible (this site loads in about one second!). We have a printer, but we don’t use it all that much. We don’t commute anywhere (or even own a car) and our home office uses 100% renewable energy. (It may or may not help that we live in the windiest country in Europe. 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿)</p><h2>How these hearts define our business</h2><p><strong>Everything we do is derived from these three pillars.</strong> Our values, brand, and design principles (more on all of these later) all tie back to our ethics. Every decision we make—whether to include a pop-up here, which analytics package to use, or whether to pursue a new contract—is assessed through these lenses. Ethics aren’t the <em>only</em> metrics by which we make our decisions, but they’re a hugely important component.</p><p>The tricky thing about ethics—and being public about those ethics—is there’s a risk you might get it wrong. Getting a <em>fact</em> wrong in public is one thing, but getting your <em>ethics</em> wrong is a whole other thing entirely. Reputations have been made and ruined (mostly ruined) by a misguided tweet.</p><p>We’re okay with that risk. We respect people enough to think they’ll understand when we get it wrong and that we’re always learning. <strong>We’d rather try and fail than not try at all.</strong> We genuinely believe that by being as transparent as possible, we hold ourselves more accountable to our own standards.</p><p>So that’s where you come in! If you see us getting it wrong, or if we’re failing to consider things fully, or if we could be making better decisions, let us know! We don’t mind being wrong when it’s an opportunity to improve our future selves. ❤️❤️❤️</p>]]></description><link>https://octopusthink.com/blog/2019-11-22-ethics-at-the-heart-of-business</link><guid isPermaLink="true">https://octopusthink.com/blog/2019-11-22-ethics-at-the-heart-of-business</guid><dc:creator><![CDATA[Sarah London Semark]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Fri, 22 Nov 2019 00:00:00 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[Happy Octopus Day!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>We’ve been very busy working on Secretive Things and Underwater Planning and (some of us) have been even taking a break before diving into projects, but we couldn’t resist putting a wee something together in celebration of our first <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/world-octopus-day/">World Octopus Day</a>:</p><p><a href="https://funfactsaboutoctopus.es">funfactsaboutoctopus.es</a></p><p>We’ve started it off with eight of our favourite octopus facts, and we’ll be adding to it sporadically (the best interval!) over the next year.

We're Octopus Think.]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Hi there! We’re <a href="https://triggersandsparks.com">Sarah</a> and <a href="https://tofumatt.com">Matt</a>.</p><p>Together, we’re <strong>Octopus Think</strong>, a digital design and development agency. We’re based in beautiful Edinburgh, Scotland but we’re both frequent travellers and can often be found travelling the globe. 🌍</p><p>We build accessible, fast, and thoughtful apps and websites. We design inclusive, usable, and beautiful experiences, interfaces, and communications. We’re always learning and teaching others. We’re experienced public speakers and leaders who empower people to build awesome stuff. And above all, we believe in the power of technology to <strong>solve problems</strong> and make the world a better place. ✌️</p><h2>Who are we anyway?</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/sarahsemark">Sarah</a> (she/her) calls herself a “designer who codes”, which basically means she’s a control freak who gets her hands messy and breaks things. Her background is in graphic and web design, but she moved into product and UX design once she realised she cares just as much about <strong>how it works</strong> as how it looks. She’s a thoughtful and holistic designer who connects the user experience from research through to delivery.</p><p>Sarah is passionate about leveraging technology in order to create social change and <strong>make the world a more equitable place</strong>. In her spare time, she likes to renovate our flat and go for long hikes in the woods. 🌳</p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/tofumatt">Matt</a> (he/him) is a full-stack developer with a wide range of skills. You’ll most often see him working with React front-ends or messing about with Kubernetes. An <strong>advocate for accessibility and inclusion</strong>, Matt embraces best practises and new technology to ensure no one is left out. He loves using technology to automate tasks, and he writes copious tests so that things (almost) never break.</p><p>Matt is an avid motorcyclist and coffee equipment enthusiast. It’s possible he needs more storage space. 🛵</p><p><strong>Together</strong>, we’ve worked on an array of different one-off projects over the years. Realising the world could use more accessible, thoughtfully-designed, and lovingly-crafted apps, interfaces, and websites, we’ve decided to team up and build great things together.</p><p>Having highly complementary skills, we’re able have joint ownership and make decisions in a diplomatic way. Where we <em>do</em> overlap are the passions that ignite us: <strong>automation, empowerment, inclusion, and social justice</strong>. That’s where we’ll be directing the majority of our efforts. 🔥</p><h2>What to expect from this blog</h2><p>We’re still figuring things out, but expect us to talk about things that matter most to us. <strong>Design and technology</strong>. <strong>Accessibility and inclusion</strong>. Oh, and adorable cephalopod stories, because we aren’t made of stone. <em>Those suckers are really cute.</em> 🐙</p><h2>What we’re working on</h2><p>Recently, our time has been devoted to <a href="https://nautilus.octopusthink.com/">Nautilus</a>, our open-source, inclusive design system. We couldn’t find a good solution in the existing React component library/design system ecosystem—so we started building our own. It’s a <em>ton</em> of work but it’s <em>super</em> rewarding, and we’ll be sharing more about what we’ve learned here soon.</p><p>Nautilus is designed and developed almost entirely in the open. Our aim is to build a truly <strong>accessible, flexible, and straightforward design system</strong> (and component library!) for designers and developers to use.</p><p>We’re also frequent open source contributors to projects like <a href="https://github.com/localForage/localForage">localForage</a>, <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/addons-frontend/">Mozilla Add-ons</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg">WordPress</a>.</p><p>As for the future, we have a <em>lot</em> of different ideas brewing. Follow along to see what happens! ❤️</p><h2>Follow along</h2><p>Want to keep track of what we’re up to?
