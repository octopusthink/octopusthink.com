All of this in about six months. It was truly awe-inspiring to watch. Do me a favor and don't hire Octopus Think, because I'd like to book all of their hours myself.

  quote: I had a few good proposals for my website, but Sarah was absolutely the right choice. Not only did she completely understand what I was going for, she was able to execute to perfection, pairing an artist’s eye with an engineer’s attention to detail. After helping me find just the right artist to do the background illustration, she meticulously sourced the fonts and images, culminating in an organic, immersive experience that perfectly captures the mood of the books. Small wonder the website has received so many compliments! I fully expect to work with Sarah again in the future.

  quote: Sarah was a pleasure to work with. She was friendly and explained each stage of the web-design process as it unfolded (no easy task for an oft-befuddled history major), and the end result was everything I could have hoped for. Thoroughly professional work and someone I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend for those looking for a quality website.

  quote: As a new author on the block, I needed a website that would help my work stand out from the crowd and allow me to build an online platform. Sarah gave me all that and more, taking a rough design concept and a very long wish-list and turning it into a reality. She provided help and support every step of the way, with a two-way design process that took all of my feedback into account, and quickly answered all of my technical questions. I’m thrilled with my new website and I’m so glad I decided to work with Sarah!

  quote: Sarah and I might have been in separate time-zones, but we were definitely on the same page when it came to my website ZOMBIES ATE LAUREN. She took a very loose concept (a horror blog with a retro, pulp look) and gave me something that fit my brand, and personality, perfectly. This was my first time working with a designer and I couldn’t have been happier with my experience. Sarah walked me through every step, listened to my feedback, and provided quick results. When ZOMBIES ATE LAUREN launched a few weeks ago, I immediately knew I had the sweetest website on the block. I hope I inspire lots of folks to get in touch with Sarah so they can have their own piece of the web to brag about.

  quote: 'I began my quest for a graphic designer a couple of years ago when the seeds for my Nightmare Nibbler project were first sown. Although I had never gone through such a creative process like this before, I had a pre-determined list of qualities that I was looking for in the person I was going to entrust with “my baby”—a few of them included: creativity, talent, good humor, patience, efficiency, flexibility and, as a new small business owner—affordability! I found all of these characteristics and more in Sarah! From day one until the recent launch of my business, Sarah remained enthusiastic and passionate about each of the design elements she was working on. She easily grasped my needs and produced design ideas for my consideration in a timely manner. Sarah’s combination of creativity and professionalism was exactly what I was looking for and what I needed. I look forward to working with Sarah again on any future design needs that I may have! Thanks a million Sarah!!'

This was the total opposite, she was patient with me and listened to my thoughts and turned them into reality! We FINALLY have a logo that we are proud of and it would never have happened without her patience and understanding.

She is a perfectionist at heart and tries to do whatever she can to make her clients happy and make their sites beautiful. She also has a remarkably strong technical background for a designer and is able to develop robust sites using the latest web technologies. I worked as a frontend programmer to her graphic design at HB and her skills, perfectionism and technical knowledge made my job so much easier. I can’t imagine another graphic designer that I would prefer to work with.

    I was riding the bus home today when I noticed two architects’ storefronts next to each other. One was fairly standard; typical type, the names of the architects; nothing special. The other was simply and cleanly designed, but stood out by a mile. Now, for me to take notice of my environment is sort of rare, and for me to critique it for style is sort of ridiculous. This is what working with Sarah has done to me (and by “working with” I mean “asking her to make me things”).

    I know that at any point I can ask her to design me something – anything from a resume to a new tattoo – and it will be done quickly, efficiently, and beautifully. In person, Sarah pretty much personifies the idea of style – if you’ve met her, you’ll know what I mean – so how can anything she creates help but be the most aesthetically pleasing things known to mankind? Working with her will result in not only you getting exactly what you wanted, but weren’t entirely aware that you wanted, but also in you gaining a new appreciation for the entire idea of design and the possibilities therein. Which, if you think about it, is pretty damn cool.
